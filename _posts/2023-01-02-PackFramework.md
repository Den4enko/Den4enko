PackFramework is a modular, performance-minded Minecraft modpack designed to facilitate the creation of custom modpacks. Accelerate your Minecraft modpack development with PackFramework. This packwiz-powered modpack offers a carefully curated collection of optimization mods for a smoother experience along with essential utility mods to expand your graphics.

### Key Features

* **Two Variants:**
  
  * **Nano:**¬†Lightweight variant focused purely on optimization for streamlined performance boosts.
  * **Normal (Ultra):**¬†Comprehensive selection of optimization and utility mods for expansive modpack builds.

* **All at once:**
  
  * Simultaneous updates of all supported versions for each Modloader Group*.

* **Modpack Development Kit(Coming soon):**
  
  * Easily create your own modpacks with automated scripts for PackFramework based development
  
  *Quilt and Fabric. NeoForge and Forge
### Important Notes

* **Not for Vanilla:**¬†PackFramework is designed for use with other modpacks. It is not so good to play vanilla Minecraft with it, I suggest you to use [FabulouslyOptimised](https://download.fo/).

* **Customization Focused:**¬†PackFramework is intended for developers and players who enjoy building their own unique modpack experiences.
